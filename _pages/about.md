The World Human Capital Expenditure (WHCE) Project is an research initiative to document, harmonise, and analyse long-run public spending on human capital. It compiles data from budget archives, statistical yearbooks, and historical records to build consistent cross-country time series from the 19th century to the present. The project facilitates comparative research on public investment in human cap8ital and its role in state formation, development, and inequality. All data and documentation are freely available to support transparency and reproducibility.
